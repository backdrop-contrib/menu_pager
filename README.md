Menu Pager
==========

Menu Pager adds blocks for each menu that display previous/next or child links,
based on the current page.

For example, given the following menu hierarchy, if you're on the 'Installing
software' page...

```
- Setting up your OS
  - Installing
  - Configuring
- Installing software
  - App store introduction
  - Installing an app
  - Finding good-quality apps
- Getting help & support
```

The 'Menu pager' block will show a 'previous' link pointing to 'Configuring',
and a 'next' link pointing to 'App store introduction'.

The 'Menu pager (children)' block will show the following links:

```
- App store introduction
- Installing an app
- Finding good-quality apps
```
