Menu Pager
==========

Menu Pager adds a block for each menu that displays previous and next links
based on the current page.

It does this by flattening the menu tree to calculate which links should come
before and after the menu link corresponding to the current page. This can
optionally be restricted to links with the same parent as the active menu link
(by default, it traverses the entire menu tree).
